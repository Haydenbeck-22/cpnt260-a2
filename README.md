# Code Review
  I ran into a bug where I could make my footer stick to the bottom of the page or occupy the correct space. I fixed it by looking up css footer tutorials, I found lots of solutions for massive multi-level footers, and it took some digging to find what I needed. Eventually I was able to make the footer do what I wanted. The benefit from running into this bug was that I learned how to make footers stick to the bottom of the page.
